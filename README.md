Alomsafer task for QA full-stack 

cypress task.


I preffer to make the data seperated from the code so in :cypress/fixtures/trip.json there is the all data you can change it and do more test cases based on the data.

1-"origrion" key to take randomly origin insert and assert it in origins also "destination" key do the same function.

2- "goDate" and "backDay" keys to control range of the trips from current day 0 to any positive integer for the buth of keys.

3-"passengertype" key change the passenger cabin from the values "Economy","first" dynamically.

4-"adultsPassengerNumber", "cheldrenPassengerNumber","infantsPassengerNumber" keys for control with numbers of passengers, as a required busseniss conditions like you (cant add infants number more than adults number).

6- i added comments to explane code blocks.

hope you like it.
